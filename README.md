## Introduction

In today's digital age, understanding human emotions from visual cues has become increasingly important in various domains such as marketing, healthcare, and human-computer interaction. The Emotion Detector project aims to provide a tool that can accurately recognize and classify emotions from facial expressions in images or videos.

## Features

- Real-time emotion detection from live camera feed or video files.
- Support for detecting multiple faces and emotions simultaneously.
- Pre-trained deep learning models for robust emotion classification.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction and visualization of results.
- Customizable parameters for fine-tuning the detection process.

## Installation

To use the Emotion Detector project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-detector.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd emotion-detector

3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run the Emotion Detector application:
python emotion_detector.py


2. Follow the on-screen instructions to select input source (camera or video file) and start the emotion detection process.

3. View the real-time emotion predictions and corresponding visualizations.

## Tech Stack

The Emotion Detector project utilizes the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Python**: The core programming language used for development.
- **OpenCV**: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library for image and video processing tasks.
- **TensorFlow**: An open-source machine learning framework for building and training deep neural networks.
- **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, used for numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **scikit-learn**: A machine learning library in Python, used for data preprocessing and evaluation of machine learning models.

These technologies are combined to create a powerful and efficient Emotion Detector application that can accurately classify human emotions from facial expressions.
